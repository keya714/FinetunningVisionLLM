Fine-Tuning Vision Transformer Model

This project demonstrates how to fine-tune a Vision Transformer (ViT) model on a custom medical imaging dataset for classification tasks. The notebook includes data preprocessing, model fine-tuning, evaluation, and visualization of results.

🧩 Overview

This notebook explores transfer learning using a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) model from Hugging Face’s transformers library. It fine-tunes the model on a radiology image dataset to adapt it to medical imaging tasks, achieving strong performance with limited data.

🩻 Dataset

The dataset used is the Radiology Mini Dataset (unsloth/Radiology_mini)
, available on the Hugging Face Hub.

It consists of sample radiology images for classification and experimentation — ideal for testing computer vision and transfer learning workflows.

You can load it directly using:

from datasets import load_dataset
dataset = load_dataset("unsloth/Radiology_mini", split="train")
